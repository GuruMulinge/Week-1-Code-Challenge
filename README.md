# PROJECT TITLE : 
WEEK 1 CODE CHALLENGE

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project is comprised of three challenges.
- Student Grade Generator
- Speed Detector 
- Net Salary Calculator

The first challenge prompts the user to input a student's marks. 

The student marks should be between 0 and 100. The program then outputs the correct grade as follows: 

``A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 59 to 49, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40. ``

The second challenge takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. 

If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

*For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.*

The third challenge takes in the basic salary and benefits of an employee. Using the KRA, NHIF, and NSSF rates it calculates the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions and net salary.

The various rates are defined in this <a href="https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.htm" target="_blank"> Link</a>

After the program calculates the payee Tax, NHIF and NSSF deductions one can compare the output with the KRA online computation provided in this <a href="https://www.kra.go.ke/en/individual/calculate-tax/calculating-tax/paye" target="_blank">Links</a>
